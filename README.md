The original idea being this project was to give the user an outlet to where they- 
could feel safe in storing their personal data that would end up containing emotions and private sentiment-
towards certain issues of theirs without the fear of being judged or constraint so they could show more of themselves-
where as other places such as in a book or through the word of mouth from friends either in real life or on the internet would not-
entirely bring up the same sense of security.

Currently the project diary1.0 is under-going its first stages, but I hope that it gets the attention it deserves so that the communities involved can have-
a secure way of sharing their most private thoughts.

Ultimately diary1.0 is to promote the well-being of others and their health.
